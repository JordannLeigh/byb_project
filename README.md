My first attempt to use git init and git status
track a new file
Output "Hello World!"
Change output to "Git is Awesome!"
Then recommit using git add
UPDATE: added functionality
1 - message now prints alternating between caps and lowers
2 - variable name for message changed to be more meaningful names
